# **PROJECT REPORT**

## **Travel Booking Platform using Agile Methodology**

---

## **1. Abstract**

A Travel Booking Platform is a web-based system that allows users to search, book, and manage travel services such as flights, hotels, and travel packages. Traditional travel booking processes are time-consuming and inconvenient. This project develops a **Travel Booking Platform using Agile methodology**, which enables fast development, continuous improvement, and customer-focused design. Agile ensures the system is flexible, efficient, and aligned with changing user needs.
