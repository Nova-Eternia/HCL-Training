# **PROJECT REPORT**

## **Healthcare Management System using Agile Methodology**

---

## **1. Abstract**

A Healthcare Management System is a digital platform used to manage patient records, appointments, medical history, billing, and hospital operations. Manual healthcare systems are slow, error-prone, and difficult to maintain. This project develops a **Healthcare Management System using Agile methodology**, which allows continuous improvement, fast development, and better quality healthcare services. Agile helps the system adapt to changing medical and administrative needs.

---

## **2. Introduction**

The healthcare industry requires accurate, secure, and fast information management. Hospitals and clinics deal with large volumes of patient data every day. Traditional paper-based systems and old software cannot meet modern healthcare requirements. Therefore, an Agile-based healthcare system is developed to ensure reliability, security, and efficiency.

---

### **2.1 Problem Statement**

Manual and outdated healthcare systems lead to data loss, slow processing, and poor patient service. Doctors and hospital staff face difficulty in accessing patient records quickly. A modern digital healthcare system is required to solve these issues.

---

### **2.2 Need of the Project**

* To store patient records digitally
* To manage appointments and doctors
* To improve healthcare service quality
* To reduce paperwork
* To allow continuous updates using Agile

---

### **2.3 Project Scheduling (Agile)**

The project is divided into sprints:

| Sprint   | Activities                       |
| -------- | -------------------------------- |
| Sprint 1 | Requirement analysis and design  |
| Sprint 2 | Patient registration and records |
| Sprint 3 | Appointment and doctor module    |
| Sprint 4 | Billing and reports              |
| Sprint 5 | Testing and deployment           |
